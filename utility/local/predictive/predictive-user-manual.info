   The package adds a new predictive completion minor-mode, called
"predictive" mode, to the GNU Emacs editor. Although there are many
options and customizations, the easiest way to start using it is to
simply install the package (*note Obtaining and Installing::), turn on
the minor-mode by running the `predictive-mode' command, and start
typing. Then come back and read up on how to tailor it to your liking.

1 What is predictive completion?
********************************

The languages we use to communicate contain a large amount of
redundancy. Given the first few letters of a word, for instance, it's
not too difficult to predict what should come next. Try it! You can
probably easily guess how to fill in the missing letters in the
following sentence:

     Giv th fir fe lett o a wor i no diffi t predi wh shou com nex.

   This is even more true of the languages used to communicate with
computers, which typically have very restricted vocabularies and rigidly
defined grammars. Redundancy occurs on many levels: on the level of
individual characters (as illustrated above), on the level of words (we
can often predict quite accurately what words are likely to come next in
a sentence, based on grammar and usage), and perhaps even on higher
levels. Predictive completion exploits this redundancy by attempting to
complete what you are trying to type before you've finished typing it.

   The predictive completion package described here is an add-on to the
GNU Emacs editor, which implements a new minor-mode called
`predictive-mode' (*note Minor Modes: (emacs)Minor Modes.). When this
predictive completion minor-mode is switched on, Emacs will try to
complete the word you are typing based on the characters typed so far.
As you add characters, it can look up words starting with those
characters in a dictionary, and offer to insert the most likely ones.
How you choose which completion (if any) to insert depends on various
customization settings, some more intrusive than others.

   Note that by only taking into account characters belonging to the
current word when predicting how to complete it, much of the redundancy
in language remains unexploited. This limitation is partly for
simplicity, but also because some of the benefits of predictive
completion would be lost if context (i.e. the preceding words and
sentences) was also taken into account.

What benefits does predictive completion bring?

  1. Saving on typing (obviously!): you don't have to type the whole
     word.  

  2. Automatic spelling assistance: when you type the first few
     characters of a word, only correct spellings of the whole word are
     offered. This is not only useful for human languages. The
     predictive completion mode can be set up to complete on variable
     and function names in a program, helping avoid bugs due to
     misspelled names.  

  3. Faster typing (possibly): not quite the same as point 1. As you
     get used to predictive completion, your fingers will start to
     learn the key sequences required for frequently used words. And
     these key sequences will usually be much shorter than typing the
     full word. (This is one reason for not taking context into
     account. If we did, the same word might require different key
     sequences depending on the words and sentences preceding it.)  

   Whether predictive mode really speeds up typing or not is debatable.
At the very least it depends on the context in which predictive mode is
used. Although you have to type less, you have to process more
information as you type, to decide whether to accept the offered
completion or whether to add more characters to narrow down the
completions to word you want. And this increased "cognitive load" might
wipe out the advantage of having to type fewer characters. Studies
indicate that the cognitive does increase, but whether or not this
negates all speed advantage to predictive completion systems is less
clear. It seems plausible that the more you use predictive mode, the
better you will become at quickly evaluating the possible completions.
Also, with the default settings, there is nothing to stop you typing
normally and ignoring the completions entirely until you want to make
use of them. In the end, the only way to find out is to try it and see!

2 Obtaining and Installing
**************************

The current version of the predictive completion package can be obtained
from `http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php'.

   If you are upgrading from a previous version, make sure you first
backup dictionaries you use by dumping the words and data they contain
to files (unless you want to start from scratch). To make the backups,
use `predictive-dump-dict-to-file'. *Note Loading and Saving
Dictionaries::. It is _not_ enough to make a copy of the dictionary
file. Only the plain-text "dumped" format is guaranteed to be portable
across different versions of predictive mode.

   _However_, this version of the predictive completion package
(version 0.22 and newer, or more specifically version 0.12 and newer of
the `dict-tree.el' library) uses a different format than earlier
versions, _even_ for the "dumped" files! To port a dictionary from
older versions to this version, use the following procedure:

  1. backup the dictionay using `predictive-dump-dict-to-file' as just
     described, _using the old version of the predictive package_;

  2. start Emacs;

  3. load the `predictive-convert-dump-format' library (included in this
     version of the predictive completion package) using `M-x load-file
     /path/to/predictive-convert-dump-format.el';

  4. open the "dumped" dictionary backup file in Emacs;

  5. run the `predictive-convert-dump-format' command;

  6. recreate the dictionary using the `predictive-create-dict' command
     (*note Creating Dictionaries::).

   Repeat this procedure for each dictionary that you want to port to
this new version.

   Older versions of the predictive completion package saved
dictionaries in a compiled form that was not portable across different
versions of Emacs. Newer versions now automatically save dictionaries
in both compiled and uncompiled forms. If you are upgrading to a
different version of Emacs, but continuing to use the same recent
version of the predictive completion package, then it is sufficient to
delete the compiled dictionary files (extension `.elc', but make sure
you do _not_ delete the uncompiled files with extension `.el'!), and
let predictive mode recompile them automatically when the dictionaries
are saved.

   However, backing up your dictionaries by dumping them to plain-text
files, as described above, is still a very good idea (just to be on the
safe side!).

   To install the package, extract the files using `tar -xvzf
predictive.tar.gz'. This will unpack the files in a new directory called
`predictive/'. Now byte-compile all the Lisp files and create the
required dictionaries by running `make' in the `predictive/' directory.
If necessary, you can specify explicitly where your Emacs resides with
`make EMACS=/path/to/emacs'.

   Then run `make install' to copy the package files to
`~/.emacs.d/predictive/' (the `~/.emacs.d/' directory will be created
if it doesn't already exist). If you want to install the files
elsewhere, you can change the default install location using `make
install DESTDIR=/PATH/TO/INSTALL/' and the package files will be copied
to the `/path/to/install/' directory.

   The dictionaries are intended to be user-specific, and _must_ be
writable by your user. If you're performing a site-wide installation of
the predictive package, the dictionary files (all files starting with
the prefix `dict-' and ending in `.elc' or `.el', _except_
`dict-tree.el') need to be copied to a separate writable directory for
each user. For this reason, the dictionaries will still be installed
under `~/.emacs.d/predictive/' even if `DESTDIR' is specified. (You
will have to copy them manually for any other users who want to use
predictive.) If you want to change the dictionary install location, use
`make install DICTDIR=/path/to/dictionaries/'. This can of course be
combined with the `DESTDIR' option: `make install
DESTDIR=/path/to/install/ DICTDIR=/path/to/dictionaries/'.

   Finally, put the following lines in your .emacs file (replace the
paths as appropriate if you're not using the default install locations):

     ;; predictive install location
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/")
     ;; dictionary locations
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/latex/")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/texinfo/")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/html/")
     ;; load predictive package
     (require 'predictive)

   Alternatively, you can save memory and only load the lisp libraries
when they're needed (i.e. when you first run the `predictive-mode'
command), by replacing the final line as follows:

     ;; predictive install location
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/")
     ;; dictionary locations
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/latex/")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/texinfo/")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/html/")
     ;; load predictive package
     (autoload 'predictive-mode "~/.emacs.d/predictive/predictive"
               "Turn on Predictive Completion Mode." t)

   If you want to install the info documentation into your local info
system, you should run the following command _as root_: `make
info-install'. If your info `dir' file is not located in
`/usr/share/info/', then you can specify its location using `make
info-install INFODIR=/path/to/info/'.

   For more details, and for alternative installation options, you
should consult the `INSTALL' file included in the predictive package.

3 Quick-Start
*************

This "Quick-Start" describes the default behaviour. However, predictive
completion mode can be heavily customized, allowing its behaviour to be
radically changed. The many and various predictive completion mode
customization options can be found in the `predictive' and
`completion-ui' customization groups. If you like the idea of
predictive completion, but don't like the way it works "out-of-the-box"
the rest of this manual explains all the options and features in detail.

   Use the `predictive-mode' command to switch the predictive
minor-mode on. The same command will also switch it off again. This
section only covers (some of) the _default_ behaviour of
`predictive-mode'. The way that `predictive-mode' works can be
radically changed via numerous customization options, which are
described in detail in the rest of this manual.  

   As you add characters to a word, predictive mode searches in a
dictionary for words starting with those characters.(1) There are a
number of different ways to choose which word (if any) should be used
to complete what you've typed.

   The most likely completion is provisionally inserted in the buffer
after the point, and highlighted to indicate that it has not yet been
accepted. The most likely completion is updated as you add more
characters to the word. Use `C-RET' to accept a completion. *Note
Dynamic Completion::, for details.  

   What if you don't want to use the most likely completion? As you
type, a list of the ten most likely completions is displayed in the
echo area and, after a short delay, in a tooltip. They are ranked
according to likelihood. Typing a number `0'-`9' will insert the
corresponding completion. *Note Completion Hotkeys::, *Note Displaying
Completions in the Echo Area::, and *Note Completion Tooltip:: for
details.  

   You can also display the completion tooltip manually, using
`S-down'. When the tooltip is displayed, the `up' and `down' keys can
be used to select a completion from the list in tooltip.  

   You can cycle forwards and backwards through the available
completions even when the tooltip isn't displayed, using `M-TAB' or
`M-/' and `M-SHIFT-TAB' or `M-?'. As you cycle, the next completion is
provisionally inserted after the point and highlighted. `C-RET' accepts
the completion, as usual.  

   Hitting `TAB' whilst completing will perform traditional
"tab-completion" on the word: the word will be completed up to the
longest common prefix of the available completions.  

   Another useful command is `C-TAB'. This accepts all the characters
from the current provisional completion as though you typed them
yourself, and re-completes the resulting, longer string -- useful if a
word just needs a suffix adding, for instance.  

   *Note Basic Completion Commands::, for details of cycling and
tab-completion.  

   `M-Down' will display a menu from which you can select a completion
(*note Completion Menu and Browser::). There is also a `Browser' menu
item, which brings up the completion browser. This hierarchically lists
_all_ possible completions, not just the most likely ones. (It can
sometimes take a while to construct the completion browser, but you can
hit `C-g' at any time to cancel it). *Note Completion Menu and
Browser::, for details.  

   `C-Down' displays a pop-up frame, in which you can use the usual
Emacs motion keys to select a completion. `M-Tab' or `M-/' in the
pop-up frame toggles between displaying the most likely completions and
displaying all possible completions. To get rid of the pop-up frame,
use `C-Up'.  

   The predictive completion package comes with an English dictionary,
which is used by default. However, this is only really included to make
sure everything works "out of the box". This default dictionary has
already been trained on a large body of English text, which means it
will take a very long time to adapt to your individual writing style.
Don't expect predictive completion mode to display particularly good
predictive powers if you stick to the default dictionary! For much
better results, you should create your own dictionary (based on the
supplied one if you like), and train it on samples of your own writing.
*Note Dictionaries::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the very first time you use `predictive-mode', there
may be a short delay when completing short strings of one or two
letters. This delay will only occur the first ever time you try to
complete that string. The delay will go away entirely the second time,
and forever after. See `predictive-completion-speed' under *Note
Creating Dictionaries:: for more information.

4 Completing Words
******************

The minor-mode command `predictive-mode' toggles the mode on and off.
With a positive prefix argument it switches the mode on, whilst a
negative prefix argument turns it off and a zero prefix argument
toggles. The `turn-on-predictive-mode' is also provided as a
convenience for use in hooks.

4.1 Overview
============

Predictive mode is extremely flexible, and how you interact with it
depends heavily on how you customize it. Broadly, there are two and a
half ways to use predictive mode: it can either do nothing until you ask
it to complete a word, or it can automatically search for the most
likely completions as you type. (You may have seen something similar to
the latter on certain models of mobile phone, though predictive mode is
far more powerful.) This behaviour is controlled by enabling or
disabling `auto-completion-mode' (*note Auto-Completion Mode::). It is
enabled for you automatically if the `predictive-auto-complete'
customization option is enabled (the default).

   The half-a-way to use predictive mode is to set
`predictive-auto-correction-no-completion'. In that case, predictive
mode doesn't complete words at all, it only auto-corrects words you
typed. For this to be useful, you also have to customize a number of
options appropriately. *Note Miscellaneous Options::.

   Even if you are using `auto-completion-mode', you can (by default)
continue to type normally. Possible completion candidates will be
displayed, ranked in order of likelihood, but will not be accepted
unless you do so explicitly using `completion-accept', bound to
`C-RET'. (All the key bindings described here are the defaults, and can
of course be customized to anything you desire, *note Keymaps and Key
Bindings::) However, since it learns as you type, predictive mode can
become very good at predicting the word you want, and it can become
tedious to have to hit `C-RET' all the time. In that case, you can
customize `auto-completion-syntax-alist' so that typing a punctuation
or white-space character automatically accepts the current completion,
before inserting the character. This lets you skip typing the rest of
the characters in a word as soon as predictive mode has found the
completion you want. However, the down side is that you have to
slightly change the way you type, and it can take a little while until
your fingers "get used to it". If you need to reject a completion
candidate, you can do so using `C-DEL' or `C-SPC' (`DEL' is usually the
`backspace' key).  

   If you aren't using `auto-completion-mode', you will need to call
the `complete-predictive' command whenever you want to complete the
word at or next to the point. This is bound to `M-TAB', `M-SHIFT-TAB',
`M-/' and `M-?'. There are then two "styles" of behaviour: completions
can either be ephemeral, acting purely as a visual indicator, and
disappearing unless you explicitly accept them using
`completion-accept', bound to `C-RET'. (You may be used to this style
of behaviour from word processing software such as OpenOffice Writer).
Alternatively, completions can be permanent, so that completing a word
really does insert those characters into the buffer unless you
explicitly reject it using `completion-reject', bound to `C-DEL'. (This
is the more traditional Emacs-style behaviour, that you may be used to
from using `dabbrev's, for example.) The choice is yours, and is
controlled by the `completion-accept-or-reject-by-default'
customization option (*note Miscellaneous Options::). (Note that these
two different "styles" of behaviour are mainly relevant when Dynamic
Completion is enabled, as it is by default. This is described below.)  

   Whether you are using `auto-completion-mode' or not, there are
various ways to display and select completions. All of them can be
enabled or disabled indepentently, and many of them can be extensively
customized.

   Perhaps the simplest is to display the most likely completion in the
buffer (*note Dynamic Completion::). You can then cycle through the
other completion candidates using the `completion-cycle' command.
`M-TAB' and `M-/' cycle forwards, whereas `M-SHIFT-TAB' and `M-?' cycle
backwards. (These are the same key bindings used to manually complete
the word at the point. Hitting them for the first time will bring up
the possible completions, hitting them again will cycle.)

   You can also insert a completion candidate directly, without having
to cycle through them until you get to the one you want, by using a
completion hot-key (*note Completion Hotkeys::). By default, the
hot-keys are the number keys `0'-`9', which insert the first through to
the tenth candidate, respectively.

   Of course, you won't know which completion candidate you want unless
you can see which candidates are available! The completion candidates
can be displayed in the echo area, and/or in a tooltip below the point
(*note Displaying Completions in the Echo Area::, and *note Completion
Tooltip::). When completion hot-keys are enabled, both of these also
indicate which completion candidate corresponds to which hot-key. If you
only want the hotkeys to be enabled when the tooltip or pop-up frame
(see below) are displayed, then set `completion-use-hotkeys' to
`pop-up'.

   The completion tooltip is more than just a visual reminder of which
completions are available. When it is displayed, you can select a
completion from the list using the `up' and `down' arrow keys. When
completing a word, you can display the tooltip at any time using
`completion-show-tooltip', bound to `S-down'. *Note Completion
Tooltip::.

   A slightly more powerful alternative to the completion tooltip is a
pop-up frame, displayed using `completion-popup-frame', bound to
`C-down' (*note Pop-Up Frame::). This lists the completion candidates
in a separate Emacs frame positioned below the point, and you can use
the usual Emacs motion keys to move through the list and select a
candidate. However, you can also toggle between displaying just the
most likely completion candidates and displaying all possible
completions, using `completion-popup-frame-toggle-all', bound to
`M-Tab' and `M-/'. You can still type and delete characters when the
pop-up frame is displayed; it will be updated to reflect the new set of
completion candidates. To get rid of a pop-up frame, use
`completion-popup-frame-dismiss', bound to `C-up' and `M-up'. (Note
that the pop-up frame key bindings are only active when the pop-up
frame has the focus. If you manually switch the focus back to the
original frame, you can still type normally and the pop-up frame will
be updated appropriately, but the `completion-popup-frame-toggle-all'
and `completion-popup-frame-dismiss' bindings will not work.)

   The completion menu is the most flexible way of selecting
completions, and can be displayed using `completion-show-menu', bound to
`M-down'. Again, it displays the completion candidates and lets you
select them, and, like the pop-up frame, it also allows you to see all
possible completions, rather than just displaying the most likely ones,
by selecting the `Browser' item from the menu. The completion browser
doesn't just display all possible completions in a big list. Instead,
it organises them hierarchically, making it easier to browse through
them until you find the one you want.

   The completion tooltip, pop-up frame, and menu all display a list of
completion candidates, but each has its own advantages and
disadvantages. The tooltip is visually and functionally least intrusive,
but also gives you fewer ways to find the completion you want. The
pop-up frame is encumbered by your window manager's frame decoration and
positioning policy (though some window managers allow you to disable
this for specific windows - called frames in Emacs). But it can display
large numbers of completion candidates far more effectively than a
tooltip. The completion menu and completion browser make finding the
desired completion much easier, especially when you're not sure
precisely what it is you're looking for. But menus steal the keyboard
focus in Emacs, so you can no longer type in the buffer until you
dismiss the menu.

   You can select one of these three (tooltip, pop-up frame or menu) to
be displayed automatically when you complete a word, by setting the
`completion-auto-show' customization option. You can optionally leave a
short delay before it is displayed, by setting
`completion-auto-show-delay'(1).

=============================

* Inserting Completions::
* Deleting Characters::


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Inserting Completions,  Next: Deleting Characters,  Up: Basic Completion Commands

4.2.1 Inserting Completions
---------------------------

`complete-predictive'
     (`M-TAB', `M-SHIFT-TAB', `M-/', `M-?') Find completions for the
     word at or next to the point.

`completion-cycle'
     (`M-TAB', `M-SHIFT-TAB', `M-/', `M-?') Cycle through available
     completion candidates. When supplied with a prefix argument, it
     will jump that many completions forwards (or backwards if the
     prefix argument is negative). `M-/' and `M-?' cycle backwards (so a
     negative argument will cause them to jump _forwards_ that number of
     completions).

`completion-accept'
     (`C-RET') Accept the current completion, and move the point just
     beyond it. If `predictive-auto-learn' and/or `predictive-auto-add'
     are enabled, predictive mode will also learn the word (*note
     Dictionary Learning::).

`completion-reject'
     (`C-Backspace', `C-SPC') Abandon the current completion, removing
     the provisionally inserted (i.e. highlighted) characters. If a
     prefix argument is supplied, predictive mode will also learn the
     resulting word, i.e. the prefix with the provisional completion
     removed (*note Dictionary Learning::). The `C-SPC' binding is only
     active in `auto-completion-mode' (*note Auto-Completion Mode::).

`completion-tab-complete'
     (`TAB') Do "traditional" tab-completion, i.e. insert the longest
     common prefix of all candidate completions, and re-complete the
     resulting longer string.  

`completion-extend-prefix'
     (`C-TAB') Insert the characters from the current completion as
     though typed manually, and look for completions of the resulting,
     longer string.  

   Note that, apart from the `complete-predictive' bindings, none of
the other key bindings are active until you have started completing a
word, either using `complete-predictive' or automatically if you are
using `auto-completion-mode' (*note Auto-Completion Mode::).  


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Deleting Characters,  Prev: Inserting Completions,  Up: Basic Completion Commands

4.2.2 Deleting Characters
-------------------------

`completion-delete-char'
     (`<delete>') Delete forwards and, after deleting, reject any
     completion at the point. A prefix argument sets the number of
     characters to delete.

`completion-backward-delete-char'
     Reject current completion, if there is one, and delete backwards.
     A prefix argument sets the number of characters to delete. If this
     deletes into a word and `auto-completion-mode' is enabled,
     complete what remains of that word.  

`completion-backward-delete-char-untabify'
     (`DEL') Similar to `completion-backward-delete-char', but changes
     tabs to spaces as it deletes.

`completion-kill-word (C-<delete>)'

`completion-kill-sentence'

`completion-kill-sexp'

`completion-kill-paragraph'
     Similar to `completion-delete-char', but kill forward until the
     end of the word/sentence/sexp/paragraph, instead of deleting
     individual characters.

`completion-backward-kill-word (C-DEL)'

`completion-backward-kill-sentence'

`completion-backward-kill-sexp'

`completion-backward-kill-paragraph'
     Similar to `completion-backward-delete-char', but kill backward
     until the end of the word/sentence/sexp/paragraph, instead of
     deleting individual characters.

   These commands replace the standard Emacs deletion and kill
commands, so that they deal sensibly with any provisional completion
that might be encountered in the region being deleted. If
`auto-completion-mode' is enabled, the backwards deletion commands also
re-complete any remaining prefix when they delete backwards into part
of a word (*note Auto-Completion Mode::). In all other respects, these
commands are identical to the equivalent standard Emacs deletion
commands with corresponding names.

4.3 Auto-Completion Mode
========================

When the `auto-completion' minor mode is enabled by calling the
`auto-completion-mode' command, predictive mode will automatically look
for completions of words as you type. This is especially useful when
used in conjunction with dynamic completion (*note Dynamic
Completion::). If you would like `auto-completion-mode' to be enabled
automatically whenever predictive mode is enabled, set the
`predictive-auto-complete' variable (set by default). Otherwise, you
will not only have to enable `auto-completion-mode' manually, but also
manually set the `auto-completion-source' to the `predictive' setting.

`auto-completion-mode'
     Enable auto-completion Mode. In this minor mode, completions are
     found automatically as words are typed.

`predictive-auto-complete'
     When non-nil (the default), enabling and disabling predictive mode
     will also automatically enable or disable `auto-completion-mode',
     without needing to run the `auto-completion-mode' command manually.

`auto-completion-source'
     If `predictive-auto-complete' is _not_ enabled, then you must set
     this variable manually to the `predictive' setting in order to use
     predictive auto-completion.

   Word-constituent characters are added to the current word before
finding new completions. The current syntax table (*note Syntax:
(emacs)Syntax.) determines which characters are word-constituents and
which are not (although the behaviour of individual characters can be
overridden).

   By customizing `auto-completion-syntax-alist', you can make
punctuation and white-space characters automatically accept the current
completion. If you want to exceptionally insert a punctuation character
as though it were a word-constituent (such as the `.' in `e.g.'), you
can often prefix the character key with `M-'. The bindings `M-.' and
`M--' are already set up by default, but you can easily add more using
the `completion-define-word-constituent-binding' convenience function
in your `.emacs' file. *Note Character Syntax and Key Bindings::, for
more details about the syntax and key binding features.  

   The following variables affect the behaviour of
`auto-completion-mode':

`auto-completion-syntax-alist'
     Whether `auto-completion-mode' allows you to type normally,
     ignoring the provisional completions until you want to use one
     (select `type normally' in the customization buffer), or whether
     punctuation characters automatically accept the current provisional
     completion before the character is inserted (select `punctuation
     accepts' in the customization buffer). For full details, see *Note
     Character Syntax and Key Bindings::.

`auto-completion-min-chars'
     Minimum number of characters that must be typed before the various
     completion mechanisms are activated when using
     `auto-completion-mode'. Note that you can still explicitly invoke
     completion on a shorter prefix using the `complete-predictive'
     command (*note Inserting Completions::).

`auto-completion-delay'
     Number of seconds Emacs must be idle before the various completion
     mechanisms are activated when using `auto-completion-mode' (*note
     Auto-Completion Mode::).

`auto-completion-backward-delete-delay'
     Number of seconds Emacs must be idle after a backwards deletion
     (*note Deleting Characters::) before the various completion
     mechanisms are activated when using `auto-completion-mode' (*note
     Auto-Completion Mode::). Having a small delay is useful when the
     delete key is held down continuously. Default is 0.1 seconds.

4.4 Dynamic Completion
======================

Dynamic completion is controlled by the `completion-use-dynamic'
customisation variable. When it is non-nil, the most likely completion
is provisionally inserted in the buffer after the point and
highlighted. If `auto-completion-mode' is enabled, typing more
word-constituent characters will add them to the word, updating the most
likely completion (*note Auto-Completion Mode::).  

   Note that since the `completion-reject' command ends the completion
process, if you want to find completions for the same prefix again
after previously rejectng a completion, you have to do it manually with
`complete-predictive' even when `auto-completion-mode' is enabled.
*Note Inserting Completions::, and *Note Auto-Completion Mode::.  

`completion-use-dynamic'
     When non-nil, enable dynamic completion, which provisionally
     inserts the most likely conpletion in the buffer.

`completion-dynamic-highlight-common-substring'
     When non-nil, the longest common substring of all the available
     completions is highlighted in a different colour within the dynamic
     completion.

`completion-dynamic-highlight-prefix-alterations'
     When non-nil, any differences between the prefix you typed and the
     corresponding characters from the current completion are
     highlighted in a different colour.

`completion-dynamic-common-substring-face'
     The face used to highlight the longest common substring in a
     dynamic completion.

`completion-dynamic-prefix-alterations-face'
     The face used to highlight differences between the typed prefix
     and the corresponding characters in the current completion.

4.5 Completion Hotkeys
======================

When the customisation variable `completion-use-hotkeys' is non-nil,
you will be able to select a completion by typing a single character
(the numerical characters `0'-`9' are used by default).

   You will probably also want to display a list of the possible
completions, so that you know which completion will be selected by each
of these "hotkeys" (*note Displaying Completions in the Echo Area::,
and *Note Completion Tooltip::). By setting `completion-use-hotkeys' to
`pop-up', the hotkeys will only be enabled when the tooltip or pop-up
frame (*note Pop-Up Frame::) are displayed.

The following variables affect the behaviour of the completion hotkeys:

`completion-use-hotkeys'
     When non-nil, enable completion hotkeys, allowing completion
     candidates to be selected by hitting a single key. When set to the
     symbol `pop-up', the hotkeys are only enabled when the tooltip
     (*note Completion Tooltip::) or pop-up frame (*note Pop-Up
     Frame::) are displayed.

`completion-hotkey-list'
     List of keys to use for selecting completions. Default is numerical
     characters 0 to 9. Note that this variable must be set _before_
     loading the predictive mode libraries, e.g. in your `.emacs' file.
     *Note Keymaps and Key Bindings::.

   Of course, however many characters are in `completion-hotkey-list',
there cannot be more completions available than the number actually
found! The maximum number to find is limited by
`completion-max-candidates', *Note Miscellaneous Options::.

4.6 Displaying Completions in the Echo Area
===========================================

If the customisation variable `completion-use-echo' is non-nil, a list
of completion candidates is displayed in the echo area. If
`completion-use-hotkeys' is also enabled (*note Completion Hotkeys::,
the hot-key characters will be displayed next to the completions they
select.

`completion-use-help-echo'
     When non-nil, a list of completion candidates (along with the
     hotkeys that select them, if enabled) is displayed in the echo
     area.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Completion Tooltip,  Next: Pop-Up Frame,  Prev: Displaying Completions in the Echo Area,  Up: Completing Words

4.7 Completion Tooltip
======================

Calling `completion-show-tooltip' when completing, bound to `S-Down'
when `completion-use-tooltip' is enabled, displays a list of available
completions in a tooltip. The `completion-tooltip-cycle' and
`completion-tooltip-cycle-backwards' commands, bound to the `down' and
`up' arrow keys, can then be used to select a completion from the list.
The following variables affect the completion tooltip: 

   The tooltip can also be displayed automatically when completing,
optionally after a time-delay. *Note Auto-Show a List of Completions::.

`completion-tooltip-timeout'
     The number of seconds to display the tooltip. The tooltip is hidden
     automatically when it is no longer needed, but it is impossible to
     display a tooltip indefinitely in Emacs. The work-around is to set
     this to a very large value. Default is 86400.

`completion-tooltip-offset'
     A cons cell containing the number of pixels (an integer) by which
     to offset the tooltip by in the x and y directions (car and cdr,
     respectively).

`completion-tooltip-face'
     The face to use in the tooltip. Only the `:foreground',
     `:background' and `:family' attributes are actually used.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Pop-Up Frame,  Next: Completion Menu and Browser,  Prev: Completion Tooltip,  Up: Completing Words

4.8 Pop-Up Frame
================

Calling `completion-popup-frame' when completing, bound to `C-Down',
displays the available completions in a separate Emacs frame positioned
below the point. You can then use the usual Emacs motion keys to select
a completion candidate and provisionally insert it in the buffer (`up',
`down', `M-p', `M-n', `C-p', `C-n', `pageup', `C-v', `M-v', `pagedown',
`home', `M-<', `end' and `M->'; you can also supply numerical optional
arguments to these, as usual).

   You can also toggle between displaying just the most likely
completions or displaying all possible completions using
`completion-popup-toggle-all', bound to `M-tab' and `M-/'. If there are
a lot of possible completions, it can take a while before they're
displayed. If it's taking too long, use `C-g' to cancel. To dismiss the
pop-up frame, use `completion-popup-frame-dismiss', bound to `C-up' and
`M-up'.

   The pop-up frame can also be displayed automatically when completing,
optionally after a time-delay. *Note Auto-Show a List of Completions::.

`completion-popup-frame'
     (`C-down') Display completion candidates in a pop-up frame.

`completion-popup-frame-toggle-all'
     (`M-tab', `M-/') Toggle between displaying the most likely
     completion candidates and displaying all possible completions.

`completion-popup-frame-dismiss'
     (`C-up', `M-up') Dismiss the pop-up frame.

   The following variables affect the pop-up frame:

`completion-popup-frame-max-height'
     An integer specifying the maximum height (in rows) of pop-up
     frames.

`completion-popup-frame-offset'
     A cons cell containing the number of pixels (an integer) by which
     to offset the pop-up frame by in the x and y directions (car and
     cdr, respectively).


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Completion Menu and Browser,  Next: Auto-Show a List of Completions,  Prev: Pop-Up Frame,  Up: Completing Words

4.9 Completion Menu and Browser
===============================

Calling `completion-show-menu' when completing, bound to `M-Down', will
bring up the completion menu, from which you can select a completion to
insert. If `completion-use-hotkeys' is enabled, the menu will also
display the hotkeys next to the completions they select, although you
will have to exit the menu before you can use them (*note Completion
Hotkeys::).

   The completion menu also contains a `Browser' entry, which replaces
the completion menu with the completion browser. This hierarchically
lists _all_ possible completions, irrespective of the setting of
`completion-max-candidates' (*note Miscellaneous Options::). If it's
taking too long to construct the browser, you can hit `C-g' to cancel
it. You can also display the browser directly using
`completion-show-browser-menu' (not bound to any key by default).

   The completion menu can be displayed automatically when completing,
optionally after a time-delay, though because it steals the keyboard
focus this is less useful than auto-displaying the tooltip or pop-up
frame. *Note Auto-Show a List of Completions::.

   The following variables affect the behaviour of the completion menu
and browser:

`completion-menu-offset'
     A cons cell containing the number of pixels (an integer) by which
     to offset the menu by in the x and y directions (car and cdr,
     respectively).

`completion-browser-max-items'
     Maximum number of completions to display in a completion browser
     menu. If there are more completions than this in a menu, the menu
     will be divided into submenus, and if necessary the submenus will
     be further divided into subsubmenus, and so on ad infinitum.
     Default is to 25.

`completion-browser-buckets'
     Chooses the algorithm used to subdivide browser menus into
     submenus. The symbol `balance' causes the number of entries in all
     menus, submenus, subsubmenus etc. to be made as equal as possible.
     The symbol `max' maximizes the number of entries in higher level
     menus (and hence minimizes the number of entries in lower level
     submenus), whereas `minimize' does the opposite. Note that none of
     these options affect the number of levels of submenu required in a
     given browser instance.

`completion-browser-buckets'
     When set, the completion browser will recursively list completions
     of completions (of completions of completions...), organised
     hierarchically. Otherwise, the browser will only display the
     original list of all completions of the prefix.

4.10 Auto-Show a List of Completions
====================================

One out of the completion tooltip, pop-up frame, or menu can be
displayed automatically when you start completing (it makes no sense to
display more than one of them at a time; they would simply mask each
other). It can either be displayed immediately, or only after Emacs has
been idle for a number of seconds. The following variables control this
feature:

`completion-auto-show'
     When set to `tooltip', `pop-up' or `menu', the corresponding list
     of completions is displayed automatically when completing. When
     nil, nothing is displayed automatically (they can still be
     displayed manually when required).

`completion-auto-show-delay'
     Number of seconds (integer) that Emacs must be idle before the
     list of completions is displayed.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Miscellaneous Options,  Prev: Auto-Show a List of Completions,  Up: Completing Words

4.11 Miscellaneous Options
==========================

The following variables affect the overall behaviour of predictive mode:

`completion-accept-or-reject-by-default'
     Determines the default action for the current completion. The
     options are: `accept' and `reject', which accept or reject the
     completion, and `accept-common', which accepts the longest common
     substring of the completion but deletes the rest.

`completion-how-to-resolve-old-completions'
     Determines what to do with old, abandoned completions elsewhere in
     the buffer. The options are: `accept' and `reject', which accept
     or reject old completions, `leave', which just leaves any old
     completions in place to return to later if you so desire, and
     `ask', which asks you whether you want to accept or reject each
     completion.

   `completion-hot-to-resolve-old-completions' controls what happens
when you move the point away from a provisional dynamic completion
(*note Dynamic Completion::) and start typing elsewhere in the buffer.
When `auto-completion-mode' is disabled,
`completion-accept-or-reject-by-default' determines how the _current_
completion behaves. If it is set to `reject', the completion
user-interfaces serve only as a visual indicators; a completion will
not become part of the buffer unless you explicitly accept it. If
`completion-accept-or-reject-by-default' is set to anything else,
completions really are part of the buffer, and you must explicitly
reject them to get rid of any inserted characters.

   When `auto-completion-mode' is enabled,
`completion-accept-or-reject-by-default' has no effect. More
fine-grained control is instead provided by
`auto-completion-syntax-alist' and
`auto-completion-override-syntax-alist'. *Note Auto-Completion Mode::.

   There is one exception to all this: whether or not
`auto-completion-mode' is enabled, if you move the point to somewhere
_within_ a dynamic completion and start typing, the part of the
completion before the point is always accepted (and the remaining
characters deleted). This is almost always what you intended, and leads
to less surprises.  

`completion-overwrite'
     When non-nil, completions overwrite the rest of the word after
     point, both when you manually call `complete-predictive' with the
     point positioned in the middle of a word, and when
     `auto-completion-mode' is enabled and you type a new character in
     the middle of a word. Enabled by default.  

   Predictive mode doesn't play all that well with `overwrite-mode'.
The `completion-overwrite' option implements an intelligent, partial
over-write behaviour for completions. This only has an effect if you
try to start completing with the point in the middle of a word. When
`completion-overwrite' is enabled, the part of the word at point that
comes after the point will be over-written by the completion. When
disabled, the completion is simply inserted in the middle of the word,
without deleting the rest of it.

`completion-max-candidates'
     Maximum number of completions to find. Default is 10.

   Setting `completion-max-candidates' to a large number is probably
not useful, and will slow predictive mode down. It is easier to type a
few extra characters than cycle through lots of completions, and the
number available directly via hotkeys is limited by the number of keys
you are prepared to set aside for selecting completions (*note
Completion Hotkeys::).

`completion-highlight-face'
     The face used to highlight the completion candidates in the various
     user-interfaces.

   `completion-highlight-face' is used to highlight the current dynamic
completion in the buffer, and also to highlight the currently selected
completion in the tooltip and pop-up frame.

`predictive-auto-correction-no-completion'
     When non-nil, predictive mode won't complete words at all!
     Instead, it will only auto-correct the words you type, using the
     definitions in `predictive-equivalent-characters' and
     `predictive-prefix-expansions' (see below). This is only useful if
     one or both of those variables have been set.

   Setting `predictive-auto-correction-no-completion' changes
predictive mode from being a completion mode to being an auto-correction
mode. It relies on you defining equivalent characters in
`predictive-equivalent-characters' or useful prefix expansions in
`predictive-prefix-expansions' (see below). For example, if the former
defines all accented variants of characters to be equivalent, then
predictive mode will auto-correct accents for you, but without offering
completions of the words. If you enable
`predictive-auto-correction-no-completion', you will almost certainly
want to enable `auto-completion-mode' (*note Auto-Completion Mode::,
change the default `auto-completion-syntax-alist' `Acceptance
behaviour' to `punctuation accepts' (*note Syntax::), and set
`completion-accept-or-reject-by-default' to `accept' (see above).

`predictive-equivalent-characters'
     A list of characters to be treated as equivalent. Each element of
     the list should be a string, and all characters appearing in the
     same string will be treated as equivalent when completing words.
     Predictive mode will then not only find completions for the prefix
     you typed, but also for all equivalent prefixes. Note that case is
     significant.

`predictive-prefix-expansions'
     An alist of expansions to apply to a prefix before completing it.
     The alist should associate regexps with their replacements. The
     result of expanding a prefix should be a valid regexp (but see
     below), which is used to match prefixes that should be considered
     equivalent for completion. The expansions are applied in-order to
     the completion prefix. Characters matching a regexp are only
     expanded once, i.e. later expansions are _not_ applied to the
     replacement text of previous expansions. Case is always
     significant.

   The result of expanding a prefix according to
`predictive-equivalent-characters' and `predictive-prefix-expansions'
must produce a valid regexp, which is used to match prefixes that are
considered equivalent to the one actually typed. Only a subset of the
full Emacs regular expression syntax is supported. There is no support
for regexp constructs that are only meaningful for strings (character
ranges and character classes inside character alternatives, and
syntax-related backslash constructs). Back-references and non-greedy
postfix operators are not supported, so `?' after a postfix operator
loses its special meaning. Also, matches are always anchored, so `$'
and `^' lose their special meanings (use `.*' at the beginning and end
of the regexp to get an unanchored match).

   `predictive-equivalent-characters' works by substituting a character
alternative listing all the equivalent characters whenever those
characters appear in the prefix. It merely provides a more convenient
way of defining these commonly used expansions, and is exactly the same
as adding those expansions on to the very _end_ of
`predictive-prefix-expansions'. Any expansions defined in
`predictive-prefix-expansions' therefore take precedence over character
equivalences defined in `predictive-equivalent-characters'.

   The main use of `predictive-equivalent-characters' is to make
certain characters, e.g. the same character with and without diacritics,
equivalent as far as completion is concerned. For example, if
`predictive-equivalent-characters' was set to
     ("[ee'e^e`]" "[EE'E^E`]" "[aa^a`]" "[AA^A`]")
   then all accented and unaccented versions of `e' will be treated as
equivalent, and similarly for `a'. So typing `et' would offer `e^tre'
and `e'tait' as completions, as well as `et'. In this way, predictive
mode can automatically correct accents and other diacritics as you type
words. As with any auto-correction or spell-checker, be careful when
using this: if there are two words that are identical up to diacritics,
such as `a' and `a`', then predictive mode can't telepathically know
which one you want(1), and will insert whichever is the most likely.

   Pre-defined `predictive-equivalent-characters' and
`predictive-prefix-expansions' settings for some languages can be
selected when customizing these variables.

`predictive-ignore-initial-caps'
     Controls whether predictive mode should ignore initial capital
     letters when searching for completions. If non-nil (the default),
     completions for the uncapitalised string are also found.

   When `predictive-ignore-initial-caps' is set, only the _first_
capital letter of a string is ignored. Thus typing `A' would find `and'
(which would complete to `And'), `Alaska' and `ANSI', but typing `AN'
would only find `ANSI', whilst typing `a' would only find `and'.

`predictive-auxiliary-file-location'
     Controls where any auxiliary files generated by predictive mode
     should be saved. It can either be a relative path, or an absolute
     path, but the former is _strongly_ recommended. If it is a
     relative path, it is taken to be relative to the file that a
     predictive-mode buffer is visiting.

     If an absolute path is used, all auxiliary files for all
     predictive-mode buffers will be saved to the same location. In
     this case, there are _no_ safe-guards to prevent two different
     auxiliary files that happen to have the same name from clobbering
     one another. That said, only identically named files in different
     directories pose a risk.

   Depending on the settings you have chosen, predictive mode may not
create any auxiliary files at all. The only one created in standard
predictive mode buffers is the buffer-local dictionary (*note Automatic
Learning::). However, the predictive mode support for a number of
major-modes makes extensive use of auxiliary files. *Note Major Modes::.

5 Dictionaries
**************

Predictive completion is only as good as the dictionary it uses. The
dictionary doesn't only list the words themselves, it also ranks them
according to how likely they are, so that predictive mode can offer the
most likely completions first.

   As you type, predictive mode learns which words you use more
frequently, so that the predictions improve. It can automatically
ensure certain words are always ranked higher than others (useful e.g.
when one word is a prefix for another).

   Predictive mode is not restricted to using one dictionary at a time;
it can use many dictionaries in parallel, and can automatically switch
dictionaries in different regions of text, the regions being defined by
regular expressions.

   And predictive mode attempts to do all of that faster than you type,
so that your typing is not slowed down even when using very large
dictionaries. (As soon as Emacs becomes sentient - surely not far off -
it will probably go on strike through being forced to work too fast!)

5.1 Creating Dictionaries
=========================

Predictive mode dictionaries store words along with their associated
weights, used to rank the words in order of likelihood. The weight is
just an integer value, which can be thought of as the relative frequency
of a word (relative to the other words in the dictionary). A dictionary
can also store prefix relationships between words, *Note Relationships
Between Words::.

The following commands are used to manually create and modify
dictionaries:

`predictive-create-dict'
     Create a new dictionary. The dictionary name is read from the
     mini-buffer. You can optionally supply a filename to associate
     with the dictionary. The dictionary will be saved to this file by
     default (just as a buffer is saved to its associated file). You
     may also supply a file containing a list of words with which to
     populate the new dictionary. The `predictive-completion-speed' and
     `predictive-dict-autosave' variables set the new dictionary's
     completion speed and autosave flag (see below).  

`predictive-create-meta-dict'
     Create a new meta-dictionary. A meta-dictionary is a wrapper
     around two or more dictionaries that behaves as if it was a
     single, combined dictionary. The weight of a word is the sum of
     it's weights in the constituent dictionaries, and the prefix
     relationships from all constituent dictionaries are merged (*note
     Relationships Between Words::). Apart from supplying a list of
     constituent dictionaries, the other options are identical to those
     for `predictive-create-dict'.

`predictive-add-to-dict'
     Insert a word into a dictionary. The dictionary name and word are
     read from the mini-buffer (defaults to the word at the point). An
     optional prefix argument specifies the weight. If the word is not
     already in the dictionary, it will be added to it with that
     initial weight (or 0 if none is supplied). If the word is already
     in the dictionary, its weight will be incremented by the weight
     value (or by 1 if none is supplied).

`predictive-remove-from-dict'
     Completely remove a word from a dictionary. The dictionary name
     and word are read from the mini-buffer (defaults to the word at
     the point).

`predictive-reset-weight'
     Reset the weight of a word in a dictionary to 0. The dictionary
     name and word are read from the mini-buffer. If no word is
     supplied, reset the weights of all words in the dictionary. If a
     prefix argument is supplied, reset weight(s) to that value, rather
     than 0.

`dictree-size'
     Display the number of words in a dictionary.

   The file containing the list of words used to populate a dictionary
has to conform to a specific format:
     "WORD" WEIGHT [PREFIX-LIST]
   Each line contains one word WORD, delimited by `""', followed by an
integer WEIGHT which specifies the word's weight, separated by
white-space from the word itself. Note that the `words' in a dictionary
do not have to be words in the usual sense. They can be arbitrary
sequences of characters, including white-space and punctuation
characters. The quote character `"' can be included in a word by
escaping it: `\"'. Optionally, a list of words which are prefixes of
WORD can be specified in PREFIX-LIST at the end of the line, again
separated from the WEIGHT by white-space (*note Relationships Between
Words::). If present, it should be of the form:
     (:prefixes ("PREFIX1" "PREFIX2" ...))
   Note that trailing whitespace on any line is _not_ allowed.

The following variables set defaults for other dictionary properties. To
change their values for a single dictionary, set the variable to the
desired value before creating the dictionary, resetting the value
afterwards.

`predictive-completion-speed'
     Sets the default completion speed of dictionaries created with
     `predictive-create-dict'. This is the desired upper limit on the
     time it takes to find completions. If it takes longer than this to
     find a particular completion, the results are cached so that they
     can be retrieved faster next time. Thus lower values result in
     faster completion, at the expense of dictionaries taking up more
     memory.

     Due to the efficient data structures used by the dictionaries, it
     is typically safe to set this quite low (the default is 0.1
     seconds). Most completions will be found faster than this even on
     slow computers, and only a few of the very slowest will need to be
     cached.

`predictive-dict-autosave'
     Sets the default autosave property for dictionaries created with
     `predictive-create-dict'. If non-nil, modified dictionaries will
     automatically be saved when they are unloaded (either with the
     `predictive-dict-unload' command, or when exiting emacs). If nil,
     any unsaved modifications will be lost unless the dictionary is
     saved manually. *Note Loading and Saving Dictionaries::.

5.2 Loading and Saving Dictionaries
===================================

`predictive-load-dict'
     Load a dictionary by name, and add it to the list of dictionaries
     used by the current buffer. The dictionary will be included when
     learning from the buffer, see *Note Learning from Buffers and
     Files::, and if its autosave flag is set (*note Creating
     Dictionaries::), it will automatically be saved when the buffer is
     killed. The dictionary file must be in your `load-path'.

     You should never normally need to use this command interactively,
     since predictive mode loads and unloads dictionaries
     automatically, as needed.

`dictree-load'
     Load a dictionary from file. The name of the loaded dictionary is
     the same as the file name, with the extension removed. This will
     not add it to the list of dictionaries used by the current buffer
     (see `predictive-load-dict', above).

`predictive-unload-dict'
     Remove a dictionary from the list of dictionaries used by the
     current buffer. If the dictionary is no longer used by any other
     buffer, this also unloads it from Emacs. In that case, if its
     autosave flag is set, the dictionary will be saved before being
     unloaded (*note Creating Dictionaries::), unless this is
     overridden by supplying a prefix argument.

     You should never normally need to use this command interactively,
     since predictive mode loads and unloads dictionaries
     automatically, as needed.

`dictree-unload'
     You probably don't want to do this! Unloading a dictionary that's
     still in use will cripple predictive mode, resulting in it spewing
     out incomprehensible Lisp errors. This command unconditionally
     unloads a dictionary. If the dictionary's autosave flag is set,
     this will also save it (*note Creating Dictionaries::), unless
     overridden by supplying a prefix argument.

`predictive-save-dict'
     Save a dictionary to its associated file. Prompt for a file name if
     there is none associated with the dictionary.

`predictive-write-dict'
     Write a dictionary to a file specified via the mini-buffer. This
     also associates the dictionary with that file. If a prefix
     argument is supplied, you will _not_ be asked to confirm if
     over-writing an existing file.

`predictive-save-modified-dicts'
     Save all modified dictionaries that have a non-nil autosave flag.
     If a prefix argument is supplied, prompt for confirmation before
     saving each dictionary.

`predictive-dump-dict-to-buffer'
     Dump all words, weights and prefix relationships in the dictionary
     to a buffer, in the same format as that used to populate
     dictionaries (*note Creating Dictionaries::).

`predictive-dump-dict-to-file'
     Dump words, weights and prefix relationships to a text file rather
     than a buffer. If a prefix argument is supplied, you will _not_ be
     asked to confirm if over-writing an existing file.

`predictive-dict-autosave'
     Sets the default autosave property for dictionaries created with
     `predictive-create-dict'. If non-nil, modified dictionaries will
     automatically be saved when they are unloaded (either with the
     `predictive-dict-unload' command, or when exiting emacs). If nil,
     any unsaved modifications will be lost unless the dictionary is
     saved manually. *Note Loading and Saving Dictionaries::.

`predictive-dict-compilation'
     Determines whether dictionaries are saved in compiled or uncompiled
     form, or both. If set to the symbol `compiled', dictionaries are
     saved in compiled form, if set to `uncompiled' they are saved in
     uncompiled form, and if set to anything else they are saved in both
     forms (the default). A compiled dictionary can be loaded a lot
     faster, and is always used in preference to the uncompiled form if
     it exists. However, compiled dictionaries are not portable between
     different Emacs versions, whereas uncompiled ones are.

`predictive-dict-lock-loaded-list'
     List of dictionaries that should never be automatically unloaded,
     in addition to `predictive-main-dict' (*note Basic Dictionary
     Usage::).

   To use a dictionary, it must be loaded into memory. Usually,
predictive mode loads the dictionaries it needs automatically, and
unloads them again when they are no longer needed. Once it has been
loaded, the `predictive-main-dict' is never automatically unloaded. It
can take a while to load large dictionaries, and `predictive-main-dict'
is likely to be used by most predictive-mode buffers. If you would like
to prevent any other dictionaries from being unloaded automatically, add
them to `predictive-dict-lock-loaded'.

   You can also load and unload dictionaries manually. If a dictionary
is saved somewhere in your load path, you can load it using the
`predictive-load-dict' and `dictree-load' commands. The
`predictive-load-dict' command additionally adds it to the list of
dictionaries used by the current buffer. This has two implications: the
dictionary will automatically be saved when the buffer is killed
(assuming its autosave flag is non-nil, *note Creating Dictionaries::),
and it will be included when learning from the buffer (*note Learning
from Buffers and Files::). (You should avoid loading a dictionary using
the `load-file' command, as it will not necessarily ensure that the
dictionary is correctly associated with the file it was loaded from).

   If you want a dictionary to be loaded every time you run Emacs, and
the dictionary is saved somewhere in your `load-path', you can add the
following line to your `.emacs' file:

     (dictree-load 'DICTIONARY-NAME)

The major-mode setup functions load the dictionaries they need
automatically. *Note Major Modes::.

   A buffer is usually associated with a file, and saving the buffer
with the Emacs `save-buffer' command writes any changes back to that
file. Similarly, dictionaries are usually associated with a dictionary
file. The `predictive-save-dict' command saves any changes back to that
file. The `predictive-write-dict' command is analogous to the Emacs
`write-file' command.

   You should _never_ rename a dictionary file. (Moving a dictionary
file to another directory in your `load-path' is fine, but you cannot
rename the file itself.) The correct way to rename a dictionary is to
supply a new file name to `predictive-write-dict'.

   Dictionaries can be modified by adding words to them with the
`predictive-add-to-dict' command (*note Creating Dictionaries::). If
the auto-learn features are used, dictionaries are modified whenever a
completion is accepted (*note Automatic Learning::). The
`predictive-save-modified-dicts' saves all modified dictionaries whose
autosave flag is set. Modified dictionaries used in a buffer are
automatically saved when that buffer is killed if they have their
autosave flag set. All modified autosave dictionaries are saved when
you exit Emacs.

5.3 Basic Dictionary Usage
==========================

The name of the main dictionary used by a buffer is stored in the
buffer-local `predictive-main-dict' variable. Note that the variable
usually contains the _name_ of the dictionary (a symbol), not the
dictionary itself. This is the dictionary predictive mode will normally
search in when looking for completions.

   `predictive-main-dict' can also hold a list of dictionary names.
They are then treated as though they form one combined dictionary.
However, when `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is used, words are always
added to the first dictionary in the list. *Note Automatic Learning::.  

`predictive-set-main-dict'
     This function can be used as a convenience to set the main
     dictionary for the current buffer. You will only be able to select
     dictionaries that are already loaded (*note Loading and Saving
     Dictionaries::). If you want to set the default main dictionary
     permanently, customize `predictive-main-dict' instead.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Region-Local Dictionaries,  Next: Dictionary Learning,  Prev: Basic Dictionary Usage,  Up: Dictionaries

5.4 Region-Local Dictionaries
=============================

Using overlays, it is possible to set up dictionaries that are local to
specific regions of text. The predictive mode support for a number of
major modes makes use of this feature (*note Major Modes::). Configuring
region-local dictionaries is, however, beyond the scope of this user
manual. *Note Region-Local Dictionaries:
(predictive-programmer-manual)Region-Local Dictionaries.

`predictive-which-dict-mode'
     Auxilliary minor-mode that displays the currently active
     dictionary in the mode-line.

   Predictive mode provides an auxilliary minor-mode,
`predictive-which-dict-mode', which displays the name of the currently
active dictionary in the mode-line, i.e. the dictionary that is active
at the point. If the active dictionary is in fact a list of
dictionaries, the name of the first dictionary in the list is displayed,
followed by `...'. Positioning the mouse over the dictionary name
displays the names of the other dictionaries, either in the echo-area
(if `tooltip-mode' is disabled, or in a terminal) or in a tooltip.
However, for this to work, you have to customize part of the
`mode-line-modes' variable, as the default setting clobbers this
functionality. Find the part that refers to the `minor-mode-alist'
variable, and delete the `help-echo' property, i.e. change that part to:
     (:propertize ("" minor-mode-alist)
      mouse-face mode-line-highlight local-map
      (keymap (header-line keymap (down-mouse-3 . mode-line-mode-menu-1))
              (mode-line keymap (down-mouse-3 . mode-line-mode-menu-1)
                                (mouse-2 . mode-line-minor-mode-help)
                                (down-mouse-1 . mouse-minor-mode-menu))))

5.5 Dictionary Learning
=======================

The better the weights in a dictionary match the frequency with which
you use words, the more useful predictive mode will be. Some of the
standard dictionaries already include word weights, which match average
word frequencies taken from a large sample of texts. Some don't include
any word weights. In any case, your personal word usage might be very
different from the average.

   Ideally, the weights in a dictionary should match your personal
style of writing. In fact, since your writing style might change
significantly depending on whether you're writing, say, a scientific
article or an email, it may even be worth having different dictionaries
for different circumstances.

   The easiest way to teach a dictionary about your writing style is to
supply it with samples of your writing, and have it learn the word
weights from them. Predictive mode provides two ways to do this:
learning from existing files, and automatic learning as you type.

File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Learning from Buffers and Files,  Next: Automatic Learning,  Up: Dictionary Learning

5.5.1 Learning from Buffers and Files
-------------------------------------

Predictive mode can learn word weights from existing text. The following
commands can be used to do this. Note that they will not add new words
to a dictionary; they only update weights of words that are already in
the dictionary. The learning commands take account of region-local
dictionaries, and will ensure words are learnt in the correct
dictionaries (*note Region-Local Dictionaries::).

   Usually, you want to accumulate knowledge from each new piece of
text. But sometimes, you may want to start from scratch, and reset the
word weights to zero before starting to train a dictionary (for example,
to erase the predefined weights from the supplied English dictionary, so
that you can train it on your own writing style). You can use the
`predictive-reset-weight' command for this purpose (*note Creating
Dictionaries::).

   Note that all the learning commands (even the "fast" ones!) can take
a long time to run.

`predictive-learn-from-buffer'
     Learns weights for words in a dictionary from text in a buffer. If
     no explicit dictionary is specified, this learns word weights for
     all dictionaries used by the current buffer (*note Loading and
     Saving Dictionaries::). Each occurrence of a word increments its
     weight in the dictionary. By default, only occurrences that occur
     in a region where the dictionary is active are counted (*note
     Region-Local Dictionaries::). If an explicit dictionary is
     specified, this can be overridden by supplying a prefix argument,
     in which case all occurrences are counted, irrespective of whether
     the dictionary is active at the word occurrence. Note that you
     _cannot_ use this command to add words to a dictionary, only to
     train the weights of words already in a dictionary (see
     `predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-buffer', below).

`predictive-learn-from-file'
     Like `predictive-learn-from-buffer', but learns from a file
     instead of a buffer.

`predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-buffer'
     Similar to `predictive-learn-from-buffer'. It runs faster for
     large dictionaries, at the expense of missing some words.
     Specifically, only words consisting entirely of word- or
     symbol-constituent characters (according to the buffer's syntax
     table) will be taken into account. Also, unlike
     `predictive-learn-from-buffer', this command takes into account
     the setting of the `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' option. If an
     explicit dictionary is specified, words that are not already in
     the dictionary will be added to it if
     `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' has any non-nil value. If no
     explicit dictionary is specified, `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' has
     the usual effect, as do the other auto-add-related options (*note
     Automatic Learning::).

`predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-file'
     Like `predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-buffer', but learns from a
     file instead of a buffer.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Automatic Learning,  Next: Relationships Between Words,  Prev: Learning from Buffers and Files,  Up: Dictionary Learning

5.5.2 Automatic Learning
------------------------

Predictive mode can automatically learn which words you use most often
as you type, in order to make better predictions. This feature is
especially useful when you first start using a dictionary, to adapt it
to your writing style. Once a dictionary has been trained and is making
good predictions, it can be turned off to fix the order in which
completions are offered (*note What is predictive completion?::), though
leaving it on usually doesn't cause the order to change that much.

The following variables control automatic learning:

`predictive-auto-learn'
     Controls automatic word frequency learning. When non-nil (the
     default), the weight for a word in is incremented each time it is
     accepted as a completion, making the word more likely to be
     offered higher up the list of completions in the future. Words
     that are not already in the dictionary are ignored unless
     `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is set.

`predictive-auto-add-to-dict'
     Controls automatic adding of new words to dictionaries. If nil (the
     default), new words are never automatically added to a dictionary.
     If `t', new words are automatically added to the active dictionary.
     If set to a dictionary name, new words are automatically added to
     that dictionary instead of the active one.

`predictive-add-to-dict-ask'
     If non-nil, predictive mode will ask for confirmation before
     automatically adding any word to a dictionary. Enabled by default.
     This has no effect unless `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is also
     set.

`predictive-use-buffer-local-dict'
     If non-nil, a special, buffer-local dictionary will be created for
     each predictive mode buffer. The buffer-local dictionary is used in
     conjunction with the `predictive-main-dict', and the two act as a
     single, combined main dictionary for the buffer.  

     The buffer-local dictionary is initially empty, but whenever a
     word is learnt (auto-learnt, auto-added, learnt from a buffer or
     file, or added manually), it is added to the buffer-local
     dictionary, and its weight there is incremented by a value
     `predictive-buffer-local-learn-multiplier' times higher than for
     normal dictionaries. Thus the buffer-local dictionary will help
     predictive mode adapt much faster to the vocabulary used in a
     specific buffer than global dictionaries alone can.

     If `predictive-dict-autosave' is enabled and the buffer is
     associated with a file, the buffer-local dictionary will
     automatically be saved to the directory containing the file(1).
     When you load the file in the future, predictive mode will look
     for the buffer-local dictionary in the same directory; there is no
     need to add the directory to your load path. If the buffer is not
     associated with a file, the buffer-local dictionary will be
     discarded when you end the Emacs session.

`predictive-buffer-local-learn-multiplier'
     Sets the learning speed for buffer-local dictionaries. Whenever a
     word is added to a buffer-local dictionary, the weight increment is
     multiplied by this value before being added to any existing word
     weight. The default is 50.

`predictive-use-auto-learn-cache'
     If non-nil (the default), auto-learnt and auto-added words are
     cached, and only actually added to the dictionary when Emacs has
     been idle for `predictive-flush-auto-learn-delay' seconds or the
     buffer is killed (it has no effect unless at least one of
     `predictive-auto-learn' or `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is also
     set). This avoids small but sometimes noticeable delays when
     typing. New words or word weights will not be taken into account
     until the cache is fully flushed.

`predictive-auto-add-min-chars'
     Minimum length of words auto-added to the dictionary. When enabled,
     words shorter than this will be ignored when auto-add is used.

`predictive-auto-add-filter'
     When this variable is set to a function, and when
     `predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is enabled, the function will called
     whenever a word is going to be auto-added to the dictionary,
     passing the word (a string) and the dictionary as arguments. The
     word will only be added if the function returns non-nil. If
     `predictive-use-auto-learn-cache' is enabled, the filter function
     will be called when cached entries are flushed, not when they're
     added to the cache, allowing even time-consuming filter functions
     to be used.

   Note that if `predictive-main-dict' contains a list of dictionary
names (*note Basic Dictionary Usage::), an automatically learnt or
added word may not end up where you want it. The weight of a word is
incremented in the first dictionary it is found in, and words are added
to the first dictionary in the list (assuming
`predictive-auto-add-to-dict' is set to `t'). It is best to ensure that
dictionaries in the list do not duplicate any words.  

   The `predictive-auto-add-filter' is not a customization option, so
it can only be set from Lisp code (e.g. a setup function, *note Major
Modes::). One example of its use would be to filter out words that
contain non-letter characters (though it may be better to customize
`completion-dynamic-syntax-alist' and
`completion-dynamic-override-syntax-alist' instead, *note Syntax::).
The following will accomplish this:
     (setq predictive-auto-add-filter
           (lambda (word dict) (string-match "^[[:alpha:]]$" word)))
   Note that the function must accept both the word and dictionary
arguments, even if it doesn't make use of the dictionary.

   Another example would be to check that words are spelled correctly
before auto-adding them to a dictionary, either using `ispell' or using
the English dictionary that comes with predictive mode. This sounds
tautological, but it does make sense: the dictionary you use for
predictive completion will only contain words you've used at least once,
but typos and spelling mistakes won't make it into the dictionary
(*note Getting the Most out of Dictionaries::).
     (setq predictive-auto-add-filter (lambda (word dict) (lookup-words word)))
   Using the supplied predictive English dictionary will be faster than
`ispell', since it is optimised for looking up words, though this isn't
such an issue if `predictive-use-auto-learn-cache' is enabled (the
following assumes `dict-english' is already loaded, *note Loading and
Saving Dictionaries::).
     (setq predictive-auto-add-filter
           (lambda (word) (dictree-member-p dict-english word)))

   Other possible uses for `predictive-auto-add-filter' are limited
only by your imagination!

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In fact, two dictionaries will be saved in the directory, since
the buffer-local dictionary is composed of a meta-dictionary and a
normal dictionary, *note Creating Dictionaries::.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Relationships Between Words,  Prev: Automatic Learning,  Up: Dictionary Learning

5.5.3 Relationships Between Words
---------------------------------

As well as word frequencies, predictive mode dictionaries can store
certain relationships between words, to make learning more effective.
With each word in a dictionary, a list of other words can be
associated. Predictive mode automatically ensures that the weights of
the words in this list are always at least as large as that of the word
they are associated with.

   This is most useful when one word is a prefix for another. For
example, you may want to ensure that, however frequently the word
`learning' is used, the weight of the word `learn' is always kept at
least as big, so that it always takes precedence when completing.

   The following functions allow you to define and undefine such prefix
relationships (note that despite the command names and descriptions,
`predictive-define-prefix' and `predictive-undefine-prefix' can be used
to define relationships between any two words, not just prefixes;
however, `predictive-define-all-prefixes' and the
`predictive-auto-define-prefixes' feature can only define actual prefix
relationships):

`predictive-define-prefix'
     Define one word to be a prefix of another. Predictive mode will
     ensure that the weight of the "prefix" word is always at least as
     large as that of the other. (Note that the word does not actually
     have to be a prefix of the other; this can be used to define a
     relationship between any two words, so that the weight of one is
     always larger than the other.)

`predictive-undefine-prefix'
     Remove a "prefix" definition. (As for `predictive-define-prefix',
     the word does not actually have to be a prefix of the other.)

`predictive-define-all-prefixes'
     Add the given prefix to the prefix definitions of all words that
     for which it is a prefix, or define all possible prefix
     relationships in the dictionary if no explicit prefix is supplied.
     In the latter case, a numerical prefix argument sets a minimum
     word length for which to define a prefix relationship;
     relationships are only defined for words that are at least this
     long (the _prefixes_ defined for those words can still be any
     length).

`predictive-undefine-all-prefixes'
     The analogue of `predictive-define-all-prefixes'. Remove the given
     prefix from the prefix definitions of all words, or remove all
     prefix definitions in the dictionary if no explicit prefix is
     supplied. In the latter case, a numerical prefix argument sets a
     minimum word length for which to _undefine_ prefix relationships
     (the length of the _prefixes_ that are undefined is still not
     restricted in any way).

   The following variable is used to help guess a likely prefix as a
default for `predictive-define-prefix' and
`predictive-undefine-prefix'. It's default value is only appropriate
for English.

`predictive-guess-prefix-suffixes'
     List of suffixes to use when guessing a likely prefix for a word.
     The suffixes a tried in the order they appear in the list, and the
     first one that matches the end of the word is used: the guessed
     prefix is the original word with the suffix removed.

   Ensuring that prefixes take precedence when completing words is
almost always a good idea. It makes predictive completion much more
convenient (especially dynamic completion, *note Dynamic Completion::).
Therefore, predictive mode includes a feature that, when enabled (the
default), automatically defines all the prefix relationships whenever a
word is added to a dictionary.

`predictive-auto-define-prefixes'
     When non-nil, predictive mode will automatically update all prefix
     relationships for a word in a dictionary when the word is added.
     The new word will always take precedence over any word that is an
     extension of it, and in their turn any words that are prefixes of
     the new word will take precedence over it.

5.6 Getting the Most out of Dictionaries
========================================

As it says at the beginning of this chapter, predictive completion is
only as good as the dictionary it uses. The English dictionary supplied
with the predictive package is trained on a large body of (British)
English text, so the words and word weights it contains accurately
reflect average English usage. But you are very unlikely to write
"average" English (whatever that is!). To get the most out of
predictive completion, it is better to train your dictionary on your own
writing style, rather than someone else's.

   There are two approaches to this. The first is to create a copy of
the supplied English dictionary containing the all same words, but with
all their weights reset to zero. You can then either use the auto-learn
feature to slowly train the dictionary as you write (*note Automatic
Learning::, or better still, kick-start things by training it on text
you have already written by learning from existing files (*note
Learning from Buffers and Files::). You can of course still leave
auto-learn enabled in order to refine the dictionary, or even use the
auto-add feature to automatically add missing words as you type them
(see below).

   A variant of this approach, if you don't like the supplied English
dictionary, is to create the initial dictionary from some other list of
words, e.g. the `/usr/dict/words' file on Unix systems. You will first
need to massage the list into the format required by
`predictive-create-dict' (*note Creating Dictionaries::), which is the
same as the format produced by the dump commands (*note Loading and
Saving Dictionaries::), but this should be easy for even a moderately
savvy Emacs user(1)!

   The second approach is to start from a completely empty dictionary,
and use the auto-add feature to automatically add words as you type them
(*note Automatic Learning::). The auto-add feature adds words when you
"accept" them. Since the words aren't already in the dictionary, the
easiest way to add new words while typing is to ensure dynamic
completion is enabled, and type an end-of-word character (such as a
space or punctuation character) at the end of the word (*note Dynamic
Completion::). Alternatively, you can use the fast learning commands
`predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-buffer' and
`predictive-fast-learn-or-add-from-file' to add words from existing
text (note that you _must_ use the fast learning commands for this; the
normal ones will only increment the weights of words that are already
in the dictionary).  

   However you auto-add the words, there is a risk that some words that
you don't want will make their way into the dictionary, for example
typos and misspellings, or possibly words containing non-letter
characters. The latter are best dealt with by appropriate entries in
`completion-dynamic-syntax-alist' and
`completion-dynamic-override-syntax-alist' (*note Syntax::). The former
are best dealt with by setting a `predictive-auto-add-filter' function
(*note Automatic Learning::). It's still a good idea to occasionally
check which words are in the dictionary by dumping it to a buffer and
scanning through it by hand or with `ispell' (*note Loading and Saving
Dictionaries::).

   So which approach is better? Each has advantages and disadvantages,
and it comes down to personal preference. Training a reset copy of the
supplied English dictionary (or one built from another word list)
ensures that all the words in the dictionary are spelled correctly
(assuming the words in the list were correct in the first place). It
also means that predictive mode will provide spelling assistance even
when you type an obscure word that you've never used before. On the
other hand, the dictionary will contain many words that you will never
use, and may lack words that you do use, which will have to be added by
hand (unless you enable auto-add).

   If you write different types of text (e.g. your novel, academic
papers, and emails), the vocabulary you use will differ significantly
between the different types of text. You will get more out of predictive
completion by creating separate dictionaries for each. You can then set
up predictive mode to select the appropriate dictionary automatically,
either based on the major mode (*note Major Modes::) or, in the case of
LaTeX documents, based on the document class (*note LaTeX Support::).  

   Once you've created your dictionaries, you can use the many features
of predictive mode to tweak the dictionary training and behaviour to
suit your every desire. Using buffer-local dictionaries can help
predictive mode adapt faster to the specific vocabulary you are using
in an individual document, especially if you set a large
`predictive-buffer-local-learn-multiplier' (*note Automatic
Learning::). Defining sensible prefix relationships between words makes
sure predictive completion doesn't "get in your way" when you're typing
fast (*note Relationships Between Words::). The
`predictive-auto-define-prefixes' option and the
`predictive-define-all-prefixes' command make defining prefix
relationships very easy.  

   Finally, having gone to all this effort to create the perfect
dictionary, it would be tragic to lose it all! Make sure you
occasionally backup your dictionaries by dumping them to a plain text
file using `predictive-dump-dict-to-file' (*note Loading and Saving
Dictionaries::). This is vital before upgrading to a new version of the
Predictive package, since there's no guarantee that old dictionaries
will be readable in the new version (whereas the dumped plain-text
format is usually stable across Predictive package versions; even if
exceptionally it changes, since it's a plain-text format it will at the
very least always be readable in Emacs, and can be manipulated into the
format required for recreating your dictionary in the new Predictive
package version).

6 Advanced Customisation
************************

This chapter describes the more advanced customisation features provided
by predictive mode. Many of these are on the borderline between
user-customisations and features to be used by Lisp packages that
enhance predictive completion for specific major modes, though
describing all the features available to Lisp packages is beyond the
scope of this user manual. *Note Region-Local Dictionaries:

6.1 Character Syntax and Key Bindings
=====================================

Predictive mode significantly changes what happens when normal,
printable characters are typed. Different characters cause different
behaviour. For example, letter characters will usually be added to the
current word, updating the completions, whereas punctuation characters
end the completion process.

   This chapter describes the mechanisms that determine the behaviour of
different characters, and how to customize them.

* Menu:

* Keymaps and Key Bindings::
* Syntax::


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Keymaps and Key Bindings,  Next: Syntax,  Up: Character Syntax and Key Bindings

6.1.1 Keymaps and Key Bindings
------------------------------

The following keymaps are defined by predictive mode:

`predictive-map'
     Main keymap, enabled whenever predictive mode is.

`auto-completion-map'
     Keymap enabled whenever `auto-completion-mode' is.

`completion-hotkey-list'
     List of hotkey characters to use for selecting completions.
     Default is numerical characters 0 to 9.

`completion-overlay-map auto-completion-overlay-map'
     Keymaps active when the point is at or within a completion.

`completion-dynamic-map'
     Keymap used when `completion-use-dynamic' is enabled.

`completion-tooltip-map'
     Keymap used when `completion-use-tooltip' is enabled.

`completion-tooltip-active-map'
     Keymap active when the completion tooltip is displayed.

`completion-menu-map'
     Keymap used when `completion-use-menu' is enabled.

`completion-popup-frame-map'
     Keymap used when `completion-use-popup-frame' is enabled.

`completion-popup-frame-mode-map'
     Keymap active in the completion pop-up frame.

   The various keymaps define key bindings for different situations that
arise in predictive mode. The main `predictive-map' keymap is enabled
whenever predictive mode is enabled, and `auto-completion-map' is
enabled whenever `auto-completion-mode' is. Note: if you find yourself
thinking of re-binding printable characters in `auto-completion-map' to
something other than `completion-self-insert', don't! (at least not
until you've read on a bit). What you probably want to change are the
`auto-completion-syntax-alist' and
`auto-completion-override-syntax-alist' variables. *Note Syntax::.

   `completion-overlay-map' and `auto-completion-overlay-map' are
active when the point is located at a completion. The former is used
when `auto-completion-mode' is disabled, the latter when it is enabled.
They are used to provide key bindings for most of the completion
features.

   The key bindings in the keymaps enabled by the `completion-use-*'
customization variables are effectively added to
`completion-overlay-map', so they are active when the point is in a
completion and the corresponding user-interface is enabled.

   If the keymaps are not defined when predictive mode is first loaded
(*note Obtaining and Installing::), it creates the default keymaps and
loads them into Emacs. Therefore, to completely re-define predictive
mode key bindings, it is simpler to re-define the keymap variables
_before_ loading predictive mode (e.g. before the `(require
'predictive)' line in your `.emacs' file, *note Obtaining and
Installing::). (However, doing this for the `auto-completion-mode-map'
will almost certainly break `auto-completion-mode' entirely!) But if
you simply want to modify a few key bindings, as will usually be the
case, you can do it in the usual Emacs way, _after_ loading predictive
mode in your `.emacs' file.  


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Syntax,  Prev: Keymaps and Key Bindings,  Up: Character Syntax and Key Bindings

6.1.2 Syntax
------------

`auto-completion-syntax-alist'
     Alist associating character syntax descriptors with completion
     functions. Used by the `completion-self-insert' function in
     `auto-completion-mode' to decide what to do based on a typed
     character's syntax.

`auto-completion-override-syntax-alist'
     Alist associating characters with completion functions. Overrides
     the default function for a typed character's syntax. Used by
     `completion-self-insert' in `auto-completion-mode'.

`completion-define-word-constituent-binding'
     Convenience command for use in your `.emacs' file. It is used to
     define key bindings that insert a character as though it had a
     different syntax. Usually used to allow punctuation characters to
     be inserted one-off as word-constituents. To define KEY as a
     binding to insert character CHAR as though its were a
     word-constituent, use:
          (completion-define-word-constituent-binding key char)
     To define KEY as a binding to insert character CHAR as though its
     syntax class were SYNTAX, use:
          (completion-define-word-constituent-binding key char syntax)
     To ignore `auto-completion-override-syntax-alist' for this key
     binding, so that the behaviour is determined only by SYNTAX,
     supply a non-nil third argument:
          (completion-define-word-constituent-binding key char syntax t)

   When a character is typed in `auto-completion-mode', predictive mode
decides what to do based on that character's syntax, as defined by the
current syntax table (*note Syntax: (emacs)Syntax.). All printable
characters are bound by default to the function
`completion-self-insert', which inserts the character, looks up the
character's syntax descriptor in `auto-completion-syntax-alist', and
carries out the associated actions.  

   By default, all word-constituent characters (syntax descriptor `w')
insert the character and complete the new prefix, whilst anything else
rejects any provisional completion and inserts the character.

   Occasionally, the syntax-derived behaviour needs to be overridden for
individual characters. The `auto-completion-override-syntax-alist'
associates characters with completion behaviour and takes precedence
over `auto-completion-syntax-alist'.

   When customizing `auto-completion-syntax-alist', some useful
predefined settings are available. The `Acceptance behaviour' can be
set to `type normally' or `punctuation accepts'. Surprisingly, the
`type normally' allows you to type normally: word-constituent
characters are added to the current prefix and recompleted, anything
else rejects any provisional completion and inserts the character. The
`punctuation accepts' setting causes whitespace and punctuation
characters to instead accept the current completion and insert the
character.

   The `Completion behaviour' can be set to `word' or `string'. The
differences between these settings is subtle, and mainly affect what
happens when you start typing when the point is in the middle or end of
an existing word. Essentially, the `word' setting will try to
intelligently decide whether you wanted to add characters to the
existing word or start a new word depending on where the point is,
whereas the `string' setting will always behave as though you're
starting a new word, wherever the point is.

   For full control overlay syntax-related behaviour, you can manually
customize the entries in `auto-completion-syntax-alist'. Each
association in `auto-completion-syntax-alist' and
`auto-completion-override-syntax-alist' is a two-element list of the
form(1):
     (<accept|reject|add> <string|word|none>)

   The first element determines what happens if there is a provisional
completion at the point: `accept' accepts it, `reject' rejects it, and
`add' adds the typed character to the completion's prefix. The last
element determines what kind of completion is done (if any) after the
typed character is inserted: `string' and `word' complete the current
prefix, whereas `none' doesn't do any completion. The `string' and
`word' options differ in how they decide what prefix should be
completed when no completion is in progress. `string' takes the prefix
to be the prefix built up by typing sequential characters. `word' takes
the prefix to be the part of the current word appearing before
point(2). The difference is only evident when typing a character in the
middle or at the end of an existing word, in which case `string'
completes the newly typed character whereas `word' completes the
existing word plus the new character.

   Finally, it is occasionally useful to be able to manually override a
character's syntax, and have it treated one-off as though it had a
different syntax class. A key binding to do this can be created using
the `completion-define-word-constituent-binding' function in your
`.emacs' file (after the line loading the predictive package, *note
Obtaining and Installing::). This is most commonly used to allow
punctuation characters to be inserted one-off as word-constituents. The
bindings `M-.', `M--', `M-/' and `M-S-<SPC>' are defined by default in
predictive mode to do precisely this for the punctuation characters
`.', `-' and `/'.  

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Lisp packages can additionally set a third element that controls
whether the typed character is inserted, and can replace any element in
the list with a function that returns one of the values described here
or nil, but these features are beyond the scope of this user manual.

   (2) The value of `completion-word-thing' determines what is
considered a word. Logically enough, it defaults to `word'. Lisp
packages can redefine it, or even override the whole prefix-finding
mechanism with their own function, but this is again beyond the scope
of this user manual.

6.2 Major Modes
===============

The many features of predictive mode allow you to set things up
appropriately for whatever language you are typing, whether it be plain
text, markup languages such as LaTeX, HTML or Texinfo, programming
languages such as C or Lisp, etc. Predictive mode will work happily
alongside the appropriate major-mode. However, since each language makes
different demands of predictive completion, you may find yourself
changing a large number of settings when switching major modes.

   To facilitate using predictive completion alongside different
major-modes, predictive mode can run a setup function determined by the
current major-mode whenever it is switched on in a buffer. Of course,
you can also use major mode hooks, but hooks are less convenient if you
don't want to always switch on predictive mode in that major mode, or if
you want to switch it on and off whilst within the mode.  

`predictive-major-mode-alist'
     Alist associating a major-mode symbol with a function, which
     should take one argument. The alist is checked whenever predictive
     mode is enabled or disabled in a buffer using the
     `predictive-mode' or `turn-on-predictive-mode' commands (*note
     Basic Completion Commands::). If the buffer's major-mode matches
     one in the alist, the associated function is called with a
     positive argument if predictive mode is being enabled or a
     negative one if it is being disabled. This makes it easier to
     customize predictive mode for different major modes.  

   Since the setup function is determined by the current major-mode,
predictive mode should be switched on _after_ switching to the
appropriate major-mode. If you always want to use predictive mode with a
particular major-mode, the easiest way to do this is to add the
`predictive-mode' command to the major-mode hook in your `.emacs' file,
using a line something like this: 
     (add-hook 'MAJOR-MODE-hook 'turn-on-predictive-mode)

   The predictive package itself includes comprehensive support for
LaTeX (`predictive-setup-latex'), Texinfo (`predictive-setup-texinfo')
and HTML (`predictive-setup-html'). More contributions are always
welcome!.  You must ensure that the dictionaries required in order to
support these major-modes (which are also included in the package,
*note Obtaining and Installing::) can be found in your `load-path'. The
LaTeX, Texinfo, and HTML support goes far beyond simply changing a few
configuration variables. *Note LaTeX Support::, *Note Texinfo Support::,

6.2.1 LaTeX Support
-------------------

Predictive mode comes with comprehensive support for the LaTeX
type-setting language. With the default settings, LaTeX support is
enabled automatically when predictive completion mode is turned on in a
LaTeX buffer, via an entry in `predictive-major-mode-alist' (*note
Major Modes::).

File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Parsing LaTeX Documents,  Next: LaTeX Navigation Commands,  Up: LaTeX Support

6.2.1.1 Parsing LaTeX Documents
...............................

Predictive mode's LaTeX support parses the LaTeX file as you type
(without any noticeable slow-down!), in order to identify different
contexts. The main use for this information is to switch to the
appropriate dictionary in different regions of a LaTeX document.

   The following customization options affect this parsing:
`predictive-latex-docclass-alist'
     Alist associating LaTeX document classes (the `docclass' appearing
     inside `\documentclass{<`docclass'>}' with dictionaries.

`predictive-latex-electric-environments'
     When non-nil, environment names appearing inside
     `\begin{<`environment'>}' and `\end{<`environment'>}' are
     automatically synchronised.

   By default, predictive mode will use the usual main dictionary in
LaTeX mode, determined by `predictive-main-dict' (*note Basic
Dictionary Usage::). However, by customizing
`predictive-latex-docclass-alist', the main dictionary can be selected
automatically based on the document class.

   In addition to the main dictionary, a number of LaTeX dictionaries
are also used, grouped into four main categories: text-mode LaTeX
commands, maths-mode LaTeX commands, preamble LaTeX commands, and LaTeX
environments. The dictionaries in the different categories are used to
look for completions in different contexts in the LaTeX document. The
main LaTeX dictionaries in these categories are, respectively,
`dict-latex', `dict-latex-math', `dict-latex-preamble' and
`dict-latex-env'. In addition, there are dictionaries for LaTeX
document classes (`dict-latex-docclass'), bibliography styles
(`dict-latex-bibstyle'). Finally, a dictionary of cross-reference
labels and dictionaries of locally defined LaTeX commands and
environments, unique to each LaTeX file, are generated automatically
(*note Automatically Created Files for LaTeX::).

   Predictive mode will automatically complete words from the correct
dictionary in different regions of your LaTeX document(1). In the main
body of the document it will complete from the main dictionary, as
usual, and also from the dictionaries of text-mode LaTeX commands.
Inside `equation' or other display-mode environments, between `$''s, or
between `\[' and `\]', it will use the dictionaries of maths commands.
Inside `\begin{...}' it will use the dictionaries of LaTeX
environments. Inside `\ref{...}' it will use the dictionary of
cross-reference labels, which is created and updated automatically for
each LaTeX document. Inside `\documentclass{...}' and
`\bibliographystyle{...}', it will use the document class and
bibliography style dictionaries, respectively.

   When `predictive-latex-electric-environments' is enabled, the
environment name appearing inside a LaTeX `\end{<`environment'>}'
command is automatically synchronised with its matching
`\begin{<`environment'>}' command. The synchronisation doesn't just
occur when the `\end' command is first typed; it is kept synchronised
at all times, even when the `\begin' command that it originally matched
is deleted, causing it to match a different `\begin' somewhere else in
the document. Also, when the environment name within either a `\begin'
_or_ an `\end' command is modified, the environment name within its
matching partner is also modified accordingly. WARNING: this feature is
known to have bugs, and should probably not be used at the moment
(*note Known Bugs::).

   Predictive LaTeX mode honours the `TeX-master' variable. If it is
turned on in a buffer whose `TeX-master' variable is set to the name of
another LaTeX file, the `TeX-master' file will be visited, predictive
mode will be enabled in its buffer, and all buffers with the same
`TeX-master' will share various predictive mode settings.

   The behaviour of different character syntax classes, and the
behaviour of certain individual characters, is set up appropriately for
LaTeX (*note Character Syntax and Key Bindings::). Also, a special LaTeX
completion browser menu, more appropriate for browsing LaTeX commands,
is used instead of the default one.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The automatic dictionary switching is implemented using the
"auto-overlays" Elisp package.

6.2.1.2 LaTeX Navigation Commands
.................................

`predictive-latex-jump-to-definition'
     Jump to the definition of whatever is at the point. If point in
     already on a definition, jump to the next duplicate definition of
     the same thing. This works for cross-references, labels, and any
     commands or environments that are defined in your documents
     preamble.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-label-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a label in the current LaTeX document.
     The label is read from the mini-buffer. If the point is already on
     the label definition, jump to the next duplicate definition of the
     label.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-command-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a LaTeX command in the current document.
     The command is read from the mini-buffer. If the point is already
     on the command definition, jump to the next duplicate definition
     of the command.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-environment-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a LaTeX environment in the current
     document. The environment is read from the mini-buffer. If the
     point is already on the environment definition, jump to the next
     duplicate definition of the environment.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-section'
     Jump to a section (or subsection, subsubsection, etc.) in the
     current document. The section name is read from the mini-buffer.
     If the point is already on the sectioning command, jump to the
     next section with the same name (if there is one).

`predictive-latex-jump-to-matching-delimiter'
     Jump to the delimiter matching the one at the point, if any. This
     will jump from `\begin{...}' to `\end{...}', `\[' to `\]', `$' to
     matching `$', and vice versa.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-start-delimiter'
     Jump to the start delimiter of the innermost environment or
     equation. This will jump to `\begin{...}', `\[' or `$'.

`predictive-latex-jump-to-end-delimiter'
     Jump to the end delimiter of the innermost environment or
     equation. This will jump to `\end{...}', `\]' or `$'.

6.2.1.3 Help with LaTeX Command Syntax
......................................

Predictive mode can automatically display a reminder of the syntax of
the LaTeX command you are currently typing in the echo area. This is
enabled when `predictive-latex-display-help' is non-nil (the default),
disabled otherwise(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The only way to add new help text definitions is to dump the
relevant LaTeX dictionary to file (*note Loading and Saving
Dictionaries::), edit it manually, and recreate the dictionary (*note
Creating Dictionaries::).


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: LaTeX Packages,  Next: Automatically Created Files for LaTeX,  Prev: Help with LaTeX Command Syntax,  Up: LaTeX Support

6.2.1.4 LaTeX Packages
......................

Many LaTeX commands and features only become available when the
appropriate package is included in the document using the `\usepackage'
command. Predictive LaTeX mode supports this by automatically trying to
load package dictionaries and configuration functions when a
`\usepackage' command is typed, and unloading them again if it is
modified or deleted.

   When a `\usepackage{PACKAGE}' command is typed, predictive LaTeX
mode looks for four dictionaries based on the PACKAGE name:
`dict-latex-PACKAGE', `dict-latex-math-PACKAGE',
`dict-latex-preamble'PACKAGE, and `dict-latex-env-PACKAGE'. These
correspond to the four categories of LaTeX dictionary (*note LaTeX
Support::). If any of these dictionaries are found, they are added to
the list of dictionaries for the corresponding category, and will be
active in the appropriate regions of the document. If the text of the
`\usepackage{PACKAGE}' command is modified or deleted, the dictionaries
are removed again.

   In addition, when a `\usepackage' command is typed, modified or
deleted, predictive LaTeX mode will try to load an Elisp file called
`predictive-latex-'PACKAGE`.el[c]', and run package-specific load or
unload functions, as appropriate. The variable
`predictive-latex-usepackage-functions' is used to determine which
function (if any) to call when loading or unloading a LaTeX package
(see below). This allows arbitrary configuration changes to be made when
packages are included in or removed from the document. (A common use of
this is to add or remove auto-overlay regexps, *note LaTeX Automatic
Overlays: (predictive-programmer-manual)LaTeX Automatic Overlays.)

`predictive-latex-usepackage-functions'
     Alist associating LaTeX PACKAGE names (strings) with a list
     containing two functions: a function to be called when loading the
     package with that name (i.e. when `\usepackage{PACKAGE}' is typed),
     and a function to be called when unloading the package (i.e. when
     the `\usepackage{PACKAGE}' is modified or deleted). Entries should
     be added to this variable by the corresponding Elisp file,
     `predictive-latex-'PACKAGE`.el[c]'.

   The predictive completion package already comes with support for some
LaTeX packages, though by no means all or even the most important(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Dictionaries and Elisp code welcome!


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Automatically Created Files for LaTeX,  Prev: LaTeX Packages,  Up: LaTeX Support

6.2.1.5 Automatically Created Files
...................................

The predictive completion LaTeX support automatically creates and
updates dictionaries of cross-reference labels, dictionaries of
locally-defined text-mode and math-mode LaTeX commands (defined using
`\newcommand'), a dictionary of locally-defined environments (defined
using `\newenvironment' and `\newtheorem') for each LaTeX buffer, and a
dictionary of LaTeX section titles.

   All these dictionaries are saved to the directory specified by
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' (*note Miscellaneous Options::),
so by default they will be saved to a `.predictive/' subdirectory of
the directory containing the LaTeX file. They are given a filename of
the form `dict-latex-TYPE-FILENAME.elc', where TYPE is the type of
dictionary (`label', `local-latex', `local-math' or `local-env'), and
FILENAME is the name of the LaTeX file. Note that these dictionaries
are shared across all buffers with the same `TeX-master', and the
location they are saved to will be based on the `TeX-master' file's
name and directory.

   However, the section title dictionary is _not_ saved by default,
because doing so has a tendency to fail badly through hitting an
internal Emacs limit hard-coded into `print.c'. Since the section
dictionary is only used for navigation, there is little disadvantage in
recreating it each time the file is loaded. However, if you do want it
to be saved along with the other automatically generated dictionaries,
you should first increase this internal limit by applying the
`print.c.diff' patch (included in the predictive package) to the file
`print.c' in the Emacs source, and recompile Emacs from the patched
source. It is then safe(r) to enable
`predictive-latex-save-section-dict'.  

`predictive-latex-save-section-dict'
     When enabled, save the section dictionary along with the other
     automatically generated LaTeX dictionaries. Disabled by default
     because saving the section dictionary has a tendency to fail badly
     through hitting an internal, hard-coded Emacs limit. _Do not enable
     this without first patching Emacs as described above._

   To speed up loading of predictive mode's LaTeX support, a file
containing information about the location of different regions within
the document is saved to `auto-overlays-FILENAME' also located in
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location'. (Separate files are created even
for buffers that share the same `TeX-master'.)

   It is safe to delete any of these files, or even the entire
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' directory, as long as the
corresponding LaTeX file is not loaded in Emacs at the time. They will
be recreated automatically next time the file is loaded. However, if
you delete the dictionary files, you will lose all learned word weights
(*note Dictionary Learning::).

---------------------

The predictive mode Texinfo support shares much in common with the
LaTeX support, but Texinfo is a somewhat simpler markup language than
LaTeX (TeXnically they're both TeX, of course!). With the default
settings, Texinfo support is enabled automatically when predictive
completion mode is turned on in a Texinfo buffer, via an entry in

6.2.2.1 Parsing Texinfo Documents
.................................

Predictive mode parses Texinfo files as you type (without any noticeable
slow-down!), in order to identify different contexts. The main use for
this information is to switch to the appropriate dictionary in different
regions of a Texinfo document.

   Four Texinfo dictionaries are provided: `dict-texinfo' containing
the main Texinfo @-commands, `dict-texinfo-env' containing the
environment names (things that are ended by `@end'),
`dict-texinfo-indicating' containing just the Texinfo "indicating"
commands (*note Indicating: (Texinfo)Indicating.), and
`dict-texinfo-math' containing Texinfo @-commands that are specific to
math-mode (`@\' is the only one!). In addition, `dict-latex-math' is
used in math-mode(1) (see *note LaTeX Support::). Finally, a dictionary
of node names, a dictionary of locally defined Texinfo commands, add a
dictionary of Texinfo flags, unique to each Texinfo file, are generated
automatically (*note Automatically Created Files for Texinfo::).

   Predictive mode will automatically complete words from the correct
dictionary in different regions of your Texinfo document(2). In the
main body of the document it will complete from the main dictionary, as
usual, and also from the dictionaries of Texinfo @-commands. After
`@end', it will offer environment names as completions, whereas after
`@table', `@vtable', and `@ftable' it will offer Texinfo "indicating"
commands. Inside `@xref{...}', `@pxref{...}' and `@ref{...}', it will
use the dictionary of node names, which is created and updated
automatically for each Texinfo document. Inside `@clear{...}',
`@ifset{...}' and `@ifcler{...}', it will use the
automatically-generated dictionary of flag names. Inside `@math{...}'
it will offer standard TeX maths commands as completions(3).

   The behaviour of different character syntax classes, and the
behaviour of certain individual characters, is set up appropriately for
Texinfo (*note Character Syntax and Key Bindings::). Also, a special
Texinfo completion browser menu, more appropriate for browsing Texinfo
commands, is used instead of the default one.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It ought to be `dict-tex-math', but that will have to await TeX
support. *Note Known Bugs::.

   (2) The automatic dictionary switching is implemented using the
"auto-overlays" Elisp package.

   (3) Currently, it actually offers LaTeX maths commands, *note Known
Bugs::.

6.2.2.2 Texinfo Navigation Commands
...................................

`predictive-texinfo-jump-to-definition'
     Jump to the definition of whatever is at the point. If point in
     already on a definition, jump to the next duplicate definition of
     the same thing. This works for cross-references, node names,
     flags, and any commands that are defined in your documents
     preamble.

`predictive-texinfo-jump-to-node-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a node in the current Texinfo document.
     The node is read from the mini-buffer. If the point is already on
     the node definition, jump to the next duplicate definition of the
     node.

`predictive-texinfo-jump-to-command-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a Texinfo command in the current
     document. The command is read from the mini-buffer. If the point
     is already on the command definition, jump to the next duplicate
     definition of the command.

`predictive-texinfo-jump-to-flag-definition'
     Jump to the definition of a Texinfo flag in the current document.
     The flag name is read from the mini-buffer. If the point is
     already on the flag definition, jump to the next duplicate
     definition of the flag.

6.2.2.3 Automatically Created Files
...................................

The predictive completion Texinfo support automatically creates and
updates dictionaries of node names, dictionaries of locally-defined
Texinfo commands (defined using `@macro', `@rmacro' or `@alias'), and a
dictionary of flags (defined using `@set'), for each buffer.

   All these dictionaries are saved to the directory specified by
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' (*note Miscellaneous Options::),
so by default they will be saved to a `.predictive/' subdirectory of
the directory containing the Texinfo file. They are given a filename of
the form `dict-texinfo-TYPE-FILENAME.elc', where TYPE is the type of
dictionary (`node', `local-texinfo', or `flag'), and FILENAME is the
name of the Texinfo file.

   To speed up loading of predictive mode's Texinfo support, a file
containing information about the location of different regions within
the document is saved to `auto-overlays-FILENAME' also located in
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location'.

   It is safe to delete any of these files, or even the entire
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' directory, as long as the
corresponding Texinfo file is not loaded in Emacs at the time. They will
be recreated automatically next time the file is loaded. However, if you
delete the dictionary files, you will lose all learned word weights
(*note Dictionary Learning::).


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: HTML Support,  Prev: Texinfo Support,  Up: Major Modes

6.2.3 HTML Support
------------------

HTML is a simpler markup language than LaTeX or Texinfo, and the
predictive mode support for it is correspondingly simpler. It includes a
dictionary of HTML tags, `dict-html', and dictionaries of valid
attributes for different tags, `dict-html-TAG'. Completion is
context-sensitive: typing a `<' character will start completing an HTML
tag, whereas within a tag predictive mode will complete from the
appropriate tag attribute dictionaries. With the default settings, HTML
support is enabled automatically when predictive completion mode is
turned on in an HTML buffer, via an entry in
`predictive-major-mode-alist' (*note Major Modes::).

   To speed up loading of predictive mode's HTML support, a file
containing information about the location of different regions within
the document is saved to `auto-overlays-FILENAME' located in
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' (*note Miscellaneous Options::),
which by default is a `.predictive/' subdirectory of the directory
containing the HTML file.

   It is safe to delete this file, or even the entire
`predictive-auxiliary-file-location' directory, as long as the
corresponding HTML file is not loaded in Emacs at the time. They will be
recreated automatically next time the file is loaded. However, if you
delete the dictionary files, you will lose all learned word weights
(*note Dictionary Learning::).

7 Bugs and Future Improvements
******************************

The predictive completion package has been tested on Emacs versions
21.3, 22.x and the current CVS version, and is known to work reasonably
well. It will not work under older versions, and currently doesn't work
under any version of XEmacs.

   Report bugs and feature requests to <toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org>.
Even reports of which versions of Emacs it runs under are useful at
this stage (though check the web-site
`http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php' first to make sure your version is
not already listed).

File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Known Bugs,  Next: Future Improvements,  Up: Bugs and Future Improvements

7.1 Known Bugs
==============

Known bugs (in no particular order):

  1. Predictive mode does not work under XEmacs. Making it work will
     take some compatibility work, but should be possible.

  2. The `predictive-latex-electric-environments' feature is very flaky,
     and should probably not be used at the moment. It has occasionally
     been known to completely mess up LaTeX files by randomly deleting
     parts of them!

  3. There are probably still bugs remaining in the `auto-overlay' code,
     used in some major modes to set up region-local dictionaries. If
     you find one, please report it, along with precise instructions on
     how to reproduce it. They're fiendishly difficult to track down!

  4. The predictive mode Texinfo support uses `dict-latex-math' inside
     `@math{...}', when it should only use TeX maths commands.


File: predictive-user-manual.info,  Node: Future Improvements,  Prev: Known Bugs,  Up: Bugs and Future Improvements

7.2 Future Improvements
=======================

Possible future improvements to predictive completion (in no particular
order):

  1. Allow the learning rate (i.e. increment added each time a word is
     learnt) to be set buffer-locally and/or separately for each
     dictionary?

  2. Support for more major modes. (This one will probably be here for
     ever. I suspect new major modes are being created faster than
     predictive mode setup functions!)

  3. More predictive mode configuration variables could be allowed to
     have "overlay-local" bindings, not just the active dictionary,
     `completion-menu' function, and `completion-word-thing'.

  4. Predictive mode should be integrated with the "semantic" or similar
     package, to make it more useful for programming languages. At the
     moment, it works best with plain text and markup languages.

*********

Much inspiration for the Emacs predictive completion package came from a
similar package written for the "nedit" editor by Christian Merkwirth.
Most significantly, it provided the clue that ternary search trees are
the best data structure to use for the dictionaries.

   Ternary search trees are described in a very readable article by Jon
Bentley and Robert Sedgewick. The article can be found via
`http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/strings/'.

   Finally, the English dictionary supplied with the predictive
completion package was originally based on the British National Corpus
frequency tables, available from
`http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/~Adam.Kilgarriff/bnc-readme.html'.

D.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

D.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
